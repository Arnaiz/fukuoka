# fukuoka home files repository
This repository contains home configuration files at my Lenovo Thinkpad X220 laptop, hostname name fukuoka.

This host its not working yet since defuncts after my baby sister threw on it a big glass of water.

Last functional environment:

uname -a
Linux fukuoka 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u6 (2015-11-09) x86_64 GNU/Linux

cat /etc/debian_version
